# Pull Request Template
Use this template to make your life much easier on Github and Bitbucket. You can copy and paste this into your pull request comments or use an extension such as [Chrome Pull Request Templates](https://github.com/tcrammond/chrome-pullrequest-templates) to automatically apply your template

A PR template helps speed up the pull request flow for you by providing the reviewer a lot of extra information and saving yourself from having to remember what to include in the template.
